# How to get source and run in your machine

1. Get a git client software
2. Get the source code from repository using that software. It will download the source to a location in your hard drive
3. Without a server
 1. Double click on the index.html file present in the \src folder
 2. It will start your default browser and load the page there
 3. There will be a popup asking for permission to run JavaScript. Enable it as this is a JavaScript based application.
4. With a web server 
 1. Copy the src folder into the root folder of web server
 2. Browser to http://localhost/src/index.html. Mostly there won't be any need to enabling JavaScript
